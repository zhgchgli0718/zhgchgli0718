# Hi there, I'm ZhgChgLi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with a passion for open-source projects and building useful tools. My specialty is in iOS app development, and I also have experience working with web development using PHP, MySQL, and Laravel.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects that I've worked on:

### Swift Libraries
- [ZMarkupParser](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMarkupParser) is a pure-Swift library that helps you to convert HTML strings to NSAttributedString with customized style and tags.
- [ZPlayerCacher](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZPlayerCacher) is a lightweight implementation of the AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate protocol that enables AVPlayerItem to support caching streaming files.
- [ZNSTextAttachment](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZNSTextAttachment) enables NSTextAttachment to download images from remote URLs, support both UITextView and UILabel.

### Integration Tools
- [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender) is a tool for fetching app reviews from the App Store and Google Play Console and integrating them into your workflow.
- [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown) is a powerful tool that allows you to effortlessly download and convert your Medium posts to Markdown format.
