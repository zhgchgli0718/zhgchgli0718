# Hi there, I'm ZhgChgLi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with a passion for open-source projects and building useful tools. My specialty is in iOS app development, and I also have experience working with web development using PHP, MySQL, and Laravel.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects that I've worked on:

### Swift Libraries
- [ZMarkupParser](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMarkupParser) is a pure-Swift library that helps you to convert HTML strings to NSAttributedString with customized style and tags.
- [ZPlayerCacher](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZPlayerCacher) is a lightweight implementation of the AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate protocol that enables AVPlayerItem to support caching streaming files.

### Integration Tools
- [XCFolder](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/XCFolder) is a powerful command-line tool that converts Xcode virtual groups into actual directories, reorganizing your project structure to align with Xcode groups and enabling seamless integration with modern Xcode project generation tools like Tuist and XcodeGen.
- [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender) is a tool for fetching app reviews from the App Store and Google Play Console and integrating them into your workflow.
- [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown) is a powerful tool that allows you to effortlessly download and convert your Medium posts to Markdown format.
- [linkyee](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/linkyee) is a fully customized, open-source LinkTree alternative deployed directly on GitHub Pages.
