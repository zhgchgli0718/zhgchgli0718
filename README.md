# Hi there, I'm ZhgChgLi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with a passion for open-source projects and building useful tools. My specialty is in iOS app development, and I also have experience working with web development using PHP, MySQL, and Laravel.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects that I've worked on:

### Swift Libraries
- [ZMarkupParser](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMarkupParser): A pure-Swift library that helps you to convert HTML strings to NSAttributedString with customized style and tags.

### Fun Tools
- [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender): A tool for fetching and integrating app store and Google Play app reviews into your workflow.
- [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown): A tool for downloading Medium posts and converting them to Markdown format.


## Blog

I also enjoy writing about technology and software development. You can find some of my articles on my [blog](https://zhgchg.li) or [Medium](https://blog.zhgchg.li).
